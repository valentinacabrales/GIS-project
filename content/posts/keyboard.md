# Neighborhoods in Chicago

Hi!

This is a blog post with the porpouse of trying the plugin QGis2Web to post online QGIS maps.

#### Creation of the map

For this test I just wanted it to keep things simple. In the fist place, I downloaded the information from the Chicago data portal, specifically the shapefile of the neighborhoods in Chicago. Then, using QGIS I displayed the data, and changed the way that is visualize. For example, adding a basemap and labels of the names of the neighborhoods, also editing the simbology by classifying them in a scale of colors according to their area, where the darker ones have bigger areas than the lighter ones.
